          I'm Syona Mehra, a Financial Engineering Master's student at NYU who bridges quantitative rigor with cutting-edge AI to tackle complex, real-world challenges.
I've built cross-lingual AI frameworks delivering 30-40% performance improvements, architected GenAI systems with RAG pipelines at PwC, and founded PromptLearner‚Äîan LLM optimization platform recognized in YCombinator's top 10%. My work spans from designing real-time control systems for SpaceX's Hyperloop and Formula 1 racecars to creating accessible technology like online braille readers.
What drives me is transforming sophisticated problems into elegant solutions using Python, C++, machine learning, and data-driven methodologies. Whether it's optimizing AI systems or engineering high-performance applications, I thrive on building technology that creates meaningful impact.
Let's build something extraordinary together!
